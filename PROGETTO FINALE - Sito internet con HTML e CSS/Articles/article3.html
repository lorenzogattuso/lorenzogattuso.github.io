            <h1>Museum of Modern Art completed in London</h1>
            <p>On March 10, 2022, the Museum of Modern Art opened in London. More than 53,000 people have already booked tickets to the new museum. The permanent exhibition includes over 6,000 works many of which were donated by the English collector Robert Fox. The opening of the square building has been postponed several times since the beginning of 2020. Those who have already visited the museum are really lucky. <time datetime="2024-05-25T05:00">5h ago</time></p>
